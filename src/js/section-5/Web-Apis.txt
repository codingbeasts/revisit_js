    clearTimeout(timeoutId): Cancels a timeout set with setTimeout.
    clearInterval(intervalId): Cancels an interval set with setInterval.

2. Promise and Async Control

    Promise: Represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never.
    resolve(value): Resolves a promise with a given value.
    reject(reason): Rejects a promise with a given reason.
    async/await: Used to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable way.

3. Storage APIs

    localStorage: Allows storage of key-value pairs in a web browser with no expiration time.
    sessionStorage: Similar to localStorage, but the data is available only for the duration of the page session.
    IndexedDB: A low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files.
    Cache API: Provides a way to store and retrieve network requests and responses for offline access.

4. Fetch API

    fetch(url): A modern way to make network requests, returning promises for the results of those requests.

5. Event and Observer APIs

    addEventListener(event, handler): Attaches an event handler to a specified event on an element.
    removeEventListener(event, handler): Removes an event handler that was previously attached.
    Intersection Observer: Monitors the visibility of elements within a specified region (viewport).
    Performance Observer: Asynchronously observes performance-related metrics.

6. Web Workers

    Worker: Allows running scripts in background threads, enabling parallel processing without blocking the main thread.
    postMessage(message): Sends messages to and from web workers.

7. Geolocation API

    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, error): Retrieves the user's current geographic location.
    navigator.geolocation.watchPosition(success, error): Monitors the user's location as it changes.

8. Web Sockets

    WebSocket(url): Opens a persistent connection to a server using WebSockets for real-time data.
    send(data): Sends data through the WebSocket connection.

9. Media and Device APIs

    MediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints): Prompts the user for permission to access media devices (camera/microphone).
    WebRTC: Real-time communication for audio and video.

10. Other APIs

    Clipboard API: Reads from and writes to the clipboard.
    Notification API: Allows web pages to send notifications to the user.
    Service Workers: Acts as a proxy between a web application and the network, enabling background tasks such as caching.

11. WebAssembly

    WebAssembly (Wasm): A low-level binary format that enables high-performance applications in web browsers, allowing languages like C, C++, and Rust to be compiled for the web.

12. SVG and Canvas APIs

    Canvas API: Allows for drawing graphics using JavaScript, enabling the creation of dynamic, visual content such as games and graphs.
    SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics): A markup language for describing two-dimensional vector graphics. JavaScript can manipulate SVG elements directly.

13. Accessibility APIs

    ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications): Attributes that enhance the accessibility of web content for users with disabilities.
    Screen Reader APIs: Allow for the interaction with assistive technology to improve user experience for visually impaired users.

14. Device Orientation and Motion APIs

    DeviceOrientation API: Provides information about the physical orientation of a device.
    DeviceMotion API: Gives acceleration and rotation data from the device’s sensors.

15. Fetch and Response Streams

    ReadableStream: Represents data that can be read from.
    WritableStream: Represents data that can be written to.
    Response.body: Returns a readable stream allowing progressive processing of data.

16. Payment Request API

    Payment Request: Provides a standardized way to initiate payments from within a web application, allowing users to pay with stored payment methods.

17. Web Push Notifications

    Push API: Allows servers to send messages and notifications to web applications even when the application is not open in the browser.

18. History and Navigation APIs

    History API: Allows manipulating the browser session history, enabling dynamic navigation in single-page applications (SPA).
    Location API: Provides access to the current URL and methods for modifying it.

19. Custom Elements and Shadow DOM

    Web Components: A suite of technologies (including custom elements and shadow DOM) that allow for the creation of reusable custom HTML elements.

20. Fetch API Enhancements

    AbortController: Allows you to abort requests made with the Fetch API, improving control over network requests.
